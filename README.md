# An implementation of Advent of Code 2020

This is a Lua (5.4.0) implementation of this year's Advent of Code.

# How to run the code?

You'll need a working Lua installation: you can [build it yourself](https://www.lua.org/download.html) with a working C compiler, or [download a pre-built binary](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/) if you don't want to bother with building it.

Each day has a directory of its own and generally has an input file (eg. _input.txt_) and a main file (eg. _main.lua_) that Lua has to run (eg. `lua main.lua`).

# About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
